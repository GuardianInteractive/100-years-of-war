In the following years, the British government sought more cuts from the military budget. But the Treaty of Versailles did not bring even a short-lived peace for British forces. That year saw British forces in action round the world, including a large-scale intervention in Russia. The treaty also saw Britain add to its already extensive colonies and these acquisitions led to a series of police actions. Some of these police actions were small-scale but still resulted in high civilian death tolls. Because of the reluctance of the Treasury to sanction military spending, British forces tried to police its colonies where possible through air attacks - a cheap option - rather than the more expensive one of putting boots on the ground.<br><br><a href=\"http://century.theguardian.com/1910-1919/Story/0,,126538,00.html\">Read the Guardian's original report of the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.</a></p> <video id='video' controls='' preload='none' poster='http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/9/1389285687289/vlcsnap-2013-12-20-16h54m27s251.png'>\n        <source id='mp4' src='http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/mp4/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.mp4' type='video/mp4'>\n        <source id='webm' src='http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/WebM/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions.webm' type='video/webm'>\n        <source id='ogv' src='http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/oggv/768/2013/12/20/BulgariaCampConditions_h264i.ogv' type='video/ogg'>\n        <p>Your user agent does not support the HTML5 Video element.</p>\n</video>",

It was the first modern counter-insurgency campaign in which the “winning of hearts and minds” was said to be critical to success, and it ended in defeat for the communists. At the outset, however, villages were torched by police and villagers massacred by British troops. According to official figures, 10,700 insurgents were killed, captured or surrendered during the war. Some 519 members of the military and 1,346 police lost their lives, along with 3,283 civilians.<p></p><video id='video' controls='' preload='none' poster=''>\n\n        <source id='ogg' src='http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/mp4/1080/2014/02/05/140105Malaya1949_h264_lo.ogv' type='video/ogg'>\n\n        <source id='webm' src='http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2014/02/05/140105Malaya1949_h264_2M_vp8.webm' type='video/webm'>\n\n        <source id='m3u8' src='http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2014/02/05/140105Malaya1949/140105Malaya1949.m3u8' type='video/m3u8'>\n\n        <source id='mp4' src='http://cdn.theguardian.tv/interactive/2014/02/05/140105Malaya1949_h264_2M_H264.mp4' type='video/mp4'>\n\n</video>",

It is now accepted that they were reacting to the expropriation of their land. Thousands of people were detained in a vast network of prison camps, and while the abuses they suffered were officially denied, the massacre of one group of prisoners caused such revulsion in Britain that independence became inevitable. The numbers of casualties are disputed: the British and African security forces suffered around 200 deaths, while estimates of the number of civilians and Mau Mau fighters who died vary from the official count of 12,000 to as high as 100,000. Last year the British government settled a claim that a group of elderly Kenyans brought at the high court in London by expressing its “sincere regret” the use of torture during the insurgency, paying £19.9 million to 5,000 former prisoners.",

He could rely on British support to suppress them. By the late 60s, the sporadic attacks had developed into a well-organised insurgency, with both Russian and Chinese support. Determined to protect the narrow Straits of Hormuz, through which a giant oil tanker passed every ten minutes, the British placed the Sultan's armed forces under British command and drafted in young British officers. One of them was a young Ranulph Fiennes, who later wrote: “The people were oppressed and poverty stricken. The Sultan had no friends but the British. Everywhere [I] saw poverty and dirt; disease and squalor. The people jostled past and spat and stared from dark proud eyes, with hate I thought. I noticed other officers in the busy market...all carried revolvers.” Later SAS troops were dispatched, and the Shah of Iran also sent forces. British-led counter-insurgency operations lasted more than a decade, and for most of that time were conducted in complete secrecy. Just 24 British soldiers were killed, alongside around 900 Omanis and Iranian. There are believed to have been several thousand insurgent and civilian deaths. The campaign is regarded as a model of its kind and is still taught at the British military staff college.",

Over the next three years the British struggled to suppress the mounting violence. Two insurgent groups, the Marxist National Liberation Front and the Arab nationalist Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen, fought both the British and each other. In 1964 Britain found itself facing a second insurrection in the Radfan mountains near the border with Yemen. By 1967, the British were retreating behind a steadily-shrinking perimeter, eventually controlling just the harbour and the airport. One reporter described how the grounds of his hotel became a battlefield. “Gun battles raged furiously with thousands of rounds of ammunition whining and pinging around every building as NLF gunmen poured concentrated fire into every British position on a front of 400 yards.” When the British departed at the end of the year they left behind 125 dead, including several British civilians shot at their homes or offices. Dozens of soldiers and police loyal to the British also died, along with an estimated 1,900 civilians and insurgents.<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/apr/04/bloody-uprising-aden-emergency-1967\">Read an original Guardian report from 1967 of the deteriorating security situation in Aden.</a>",
